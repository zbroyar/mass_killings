# Regarding *the planned* mass murders in Ukraine

## Overview

The mass killings of Ukrainian citizens by the Russian invading troops is nothing less than *planned extermination act towards the most active group of Ukrainian society*.

Russian invading forces were incited for such social purges, as a result of years of the Russian state propaganda and their constant modus operandi[^1] in Ukraine [(see below)](Cleansing.md#%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B6%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B0-%D0%B2-%D1%80%D1%84).

## Evidences

### Executions similarity

The similarity and uniformity of executions point to same methodology. Different people in different places were executed in the similar manner.

A few patterns can be found among the mass killings of civilians in the Kyiv region:

- the vast majority are military-age males;
- with their hands tied behind their backs and shot in the back of   their heads.

Given that this method of execution:

- is relatively humane, - brain is destroyed before a person can feel the pain;
- was [widely used by NKVD](https://twitter.com/Churchill_N1/status/606656825774194690)
- is [in use in Belarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Belarus#Method)

we assume that the relevant Soviet era methodological literature exists and in posession of RU officers.

### Mass burials

In Russia, the new GOST R 42.7.01-2021 on mass burials was adopted in September 21 and put into effect on February 1, 2022, a little more than 3 weeks before the start of the open war: [National Standard of the Russian Federation. Urgent burial of corpses in wartime and peacetime](https://docs.cntd.ru/document/1200180859) ( [Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20220402173717/https://docs.cntd.ru/document/1200180859) ).

According to the standard of the Russian Federation the pit for mass burial should have the following sizes:

- 20m - length at the bottom,
- 3m - width,
- 2.3m - depth,
- 32m - at the top, including the slopes for the bulldozer/tractor.

#### Mass burials in Bucha

Coordinates: 50.548338967408654, 30.205741390181334

Length - 13.15 m, the width is variable - from 3.2m to 2.4m. The initial depth can be established only after the exhumation, the pit is currently filled with bodies.

#### Mass grave in Andriivka

Coordinates: 50.5502094, 29.8330253

Length - 10.5 meters, width - 4 m, depth - 4 m. There are no bodies in the pit. The owner of the yard received information that the pit was intended for the corpses of the villagers from the soldiers who dug the pit.

37 people disappeared in the village during the occupation. As of March 8, 2022, the burial places of 9 killed have been found or are known. Three of them were killed in a characteristic way: hands tied behind his back and a bullet in the back of the head.

### Lists

Russians have been creating lists of Ukrainians intended for extermination and isolation.

A few days before the invasion, a USUN ambassador in Geneva [wrote a letter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/read-u-s-letter-to-the-u-n-alleging-russia-is-planning-human-rights-abuses-in-ukraine/93a8d6a1-5b44-4ae8-89e5-cd5d328dd150/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4) to the OHCHR (Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights) with concern regarding this information.

### Mobile crematoria

Mobile Crematoria have been intended to hide burial of Ukrainian public and social activists, as publicly known burial sites eventually create "places of national pilgrimage" ('modus operandi' identical to the murder case of Roman Schuchevich, [see below](Cleansing.md#%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B6%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B0-%D0%B2-%D1%80%D1%84)).

UK Secretary of State for Defence, Ben Wallace, announced Russian troops preparing their mobile crematoria a day before the invasion. This fact has been published, in particular, in [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/02/23/russia-deploys-mobile-crematorium-follow-troops-battle) ([Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20220331033347/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/02/23/russia-deploys-mobile-crematorium-follow-troops-battle)). However, Mr. Wallace suggested that Russian army intended to use them to obscure its own losses while the invasion.

The following facts indicate that the crematoria were not intended for Russian soldiers:

- in those areas, where russians actually collected corpses of their soldiers – they effectively transported them outside Ukraine;
- the use of mobile crematoria for mass cremation is irrational due to [the characteristics stated by the manufacturer](http://turmalin.su/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=185&Itemid=331) ( [Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20220226133306/http://turmalin.su/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=185&Itemid=331) ):

> (translated from russian) When used for ritual purposes:
>
> - full cremation time for a single object: approx. 1 hour
> - automated ashes unloading
> - cremulation
> - an additional dust cleaning system
> - 15-16 liters of diesel fuel or 20 m3 of natural gas for single object cremation

### 45,000 body bags

The bags were intended for Ukrainian citizens.

Otherwise, if 45,000 were prepared for the corps of Russian troops, that would mean that Russian troops, counting 200,000 involved in invasion, had estimated that they would have irreversible losses at 22.5% level, and total losses (including injured and missing) reaching 90% of troops, which is highly improbable[^2].

Hence, if the body bags were actually intended for Russian soldiers, the estimated percent of the killed would be `45,000 / 200,000 x 100% = 22.5%`. According to the statistics, the number of wounded soldiers is usually 3 times higher than the number of killed ones, which means that the number of wounded Russian soldiers would be `3 х 22.5% = 67.5%`. Having that in mind, the total loss rate (both killed and wounded) would be : `22.5% + 67.5% = 90%`.

Relying on common sense, it can be suggested that starting an invasion with an estimated losses rate reaching 90% would be wildly unreasonable.

The following public materials contain calls for the forced division/redistribution of the territory of Ukraine, as well as for the killing of Ukrainian citizens.

In this case, there were two groups: "old order" representatives - the aristocracy, officials, military generals and officers - and supporters of the UPR (Ukrainian People's Republic, 1917-1920) - politicians and soldiers. After a thorough analysis of this data we may also distinguish a third group, consisting of young men."

### British intelligence position

The Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6)Twitted that they had information about planned extrajudicial killings before the invasion:

> We knew Putin’s invasion plans included summary executions by his military and intelligence services. The reports of execution-style killings of civilians emerging from liberated areas are horrifying and chilling.

[https://twitter.com/ChiefMI6/status/1510629183365517326](https://twitter.com/ChiefMI6/status/1510629183365517326)F

[^1]: Modus operandi - a Latin phrase, meaning "method of action". In plural it is called modi operandi ("methods of action"). The term is often used in police work when discussing crime and addressing the methods employed by criminals. It is also used in criminal profiling, where it can help in finding clues to the offender's psychology. (wiki)

[^2]: Typically, when planning military operations, the percentage of permissible irreparable losses (in other words, killed) is set, based on which the needs for evacuation transport, medicines, hospital places and corpse packages are further calculated. Irreversible losses are very rarely planned at more than 5%, as it is statistically known that the number of wounded is usually three times higher than the number of killed. In other words, if you plan, for example, 10% of the dead, you will need to add another 30% of the wounded, which will give a total of 40% of fighters who will lose combat capability during the operation.
